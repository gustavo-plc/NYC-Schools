# Analyzing NYC Public School SAT Scores: Insights for Policy Makers, Researchers, and Parents


1. **Overview**

    Every year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students. In this project, standardized test performance data from NYC's public schools will be used to identify the schools with top math results, analyse how performance varies by borough, and find the city's top ten performing schools!

    Skills involved: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, and insights generation.
   


2. **Problem Statement**


    This project aims to properly answer these questions:

    a) Which NYC schools have the best math results?

    b) What are the top 10 performing schools based on combined SAT scores?

    c) Which borough has the largest standard deviation in SAT scores, and what insights can we derive from it?
   


3. **Dataset**
   

    File name: schools.csv
   
    Description: Includes SAT performance data of NYC public schools (as image below).

4. Approach and Methodology

    Explain how you tackled the problem:
        Data Cleaning:
            Steps to clean the data (e.g., handling missing values, data types, and outliers).
        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
            Briefly describe the visualizations and statistics used to understand the data.
        Analysis:
            How you derived the results for each question.
            The use of calculations like percentages, sums, means, standard deviations, etc.
        Insights:
            Mention key insights gained from the analysis for each question.



5. Results

    Provide summaries and key findings for each question:
        Best Math Results: List of schools that meet the criteria, with their math scores.
        Top 10 Schools by Combined SAT: The top 10 schools and their combined SAT scores.
        Borough with Largest Standard Deviation: Name of the borough, number of schools, average SAT score, and standard deviation.
    Include links to view the DataFrames (e.g., best_math_schools, top_10_schools, largest_std_dev) or a preview of their outputs.





6. Technologies Used

    List the technologies and libraries used:
        Languages: Python
        Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn (if used for EDA), etc.
        Any other tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook for execution, GitHub for sharing).






7. Skills Demonstrated

    Highlight the specific data science skills showcased in this project:
        Data cleaning and preprocessing.
        Exploratory data analysis and visualization.
        Statistical analysis.
        Problem-solving and insights generation.
        Reproducibility with clean code and well-documented processes.





8. How to Reproduce the Project

    Step-by-step instructions to reproduce your analysis:
        Clone the repository.
        Install required libraries (pip install -r requirements.txt).
        Provide details on how to run the code and view the results (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Python script).






9. Future Improvements

    Suggest areas for further analysis or ways to improve:
        Include additional datasets for context (e.g., demographics, funding, or teacher-student ratios).
        More advanced modeling (e.g., predicting SAT scores or identifying key factors affecting performance).
        Interactive visualizations or dashboards.
